This project is based on original CenterNet - Objects as Points from [https://github.com/xingyizhou/CenterNet](https://github.com/xingyizhou/CenterNet). I added some customizations to train CenterNet on [BDD100k dataset](https://bdd-data.berkeley.edu/) for my advanced driver-assistance system project. The detailed training result can be found at [this blog post](https://aicurious.io/posts/adas-jetson-nano-intro-and-hardware/).

Notice that this repository was modified using [this instruction](https://github.com/CaoWGG/TensorRT-CenterNet/blob/master/readme/ctdet2onnx.md) and should only be used for converting models to ONNX format. Pay attention to use right version of PyTorch for this repository (v1.0 or v1.1 instead of v0.4.1 like in training environment).

Please use [original repository](https://github.com/xingyizhou/CenterNet) or [this repository](https://github.com/vietanhdev/centernet-bdd-data) to train models.
